# Security Guidelines for TheBell

## Overview

TheBell implements multiple layers of security to protect hotel operations data and ensure user privacy.

## Authentication & Authorization

### Supabase Auth
- Email/password authentication with email verification
- Secure session management with HTTP-only cookies
- Automatic token refresh and session validation

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Five distinct user roles with specific permissions
- Database-level access control using Row Level Security (RLS)
- UI-level permission checks for enhanced security

## Database Security

### Row Level Security (RLS)
All tables implement RLS policies:

\`\`\`sql
-- Example: Tasks table RLS policy
CREATE POLICY "Users can view all tasks" ON public.tasks FOR SELECT USING (true);
CREATE POLICY "Users can update tasks they created or are assigned to" ON public.tasks FOR UPDATE USING (
  auth.uid() = created_by OR auth.uid() = assigned_to OR 
  EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM public.users WHERE id = auth.uid() AND role IN ('admin', 'manager', 'operator'))
);
\`\`\`

### Data Protection
- All sensitive data encrypted at rest
- Database connections use SSL/TLS
- Environment variables for sensitive configuration
- No hardcoded secrets in codebase

## Application Security

### Input Validation
- Server-side validation for all user inputs
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- XSS protection via React's built-in escaping

### API Security
- Authentication required for all API endpoints
- Role-based authorization checks
- Rate limiting on sensitive operations

### Security Headers
Production deployment includes security headers:
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- Referrer-Policy: origin-when-cross-origin

## Environment Security

### Environment Variables
Never commit sensitive data:
\`\`\`env
# ❌ Never commit these
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=actual_key_here
DATABASE_PASSWORD=actual_password

# ✅ Use placeholder values
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
DATABASE_PASSWORD=your_database_password
\`\`\`

### Production Configuration
- HTTPS enforced in production
- Secure cookie settings
- Environment-specific configurations

## User Data Protection

### Personal Information
- Minimal data collection (name, email, role, phone)
- User consent for data processing
- Right to data deletion (admin function)

### Activity Logging
- Comprehensive audit trail
- User action tracking
- Data access logging

## Security Best Practices

### For Administrators
1. **Regular Security Reviews**
   - Audit user permissions quarterly
   - Review access logs monthly
   - Update dependencies regularly

2. **User Management**
   - Disable inactive accounts
   - Use strong password policies
   - Regular permission audits

3. **Monitoring**
   - Monitor failed login attempts
   - Track unusual activity patterns
   - Set up security alerts

### For Developers
1. **Code Security**
   - Regular dependency updates
   - Security-focused code reviews
   - Static analysis tools

2. **Deployment Security**
   - Secure CI/CD pipelines
   - Environment isolation
   - Secrets management

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Procedure
1. **Immediate Response**
   - Identify and contain the incident
   - Assess the scope and impact
   - Notify relevant stakeholders

2. **Investigation**
   - Collect and analyze logs
   - Determine root cause
   - Document findings

3. **Recovery**
   - Implement fixes
   - Restore normal operations
   - Update security measures
